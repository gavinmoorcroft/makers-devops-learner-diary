# My DevOps Apprenticeship Learner Diary

This is intended to be my Learning Diary as I move through the Makers DevOPs Apprenticeship. 

This will be the place where I keep notes and code snippets that I find useful, as well as a place for me to track my module work. But more importantly, I will use this space to track my progress through evaluations, not just into my learning rate but also my emotional state, achievements and lows as I progress.

## Diary

Each [diary](diary/README.md) will align with a single module and contain a diary of that module contianing a retrospectic on how I feel I dealt with that module, any evidence that I feel I should keep for it and anything else I feel is of use.

## Challenges
We are set a number of challenges to work on as we work through a module. I will keep these challengers in an individual file, accessable through module [diary](diary/README.md).

## To Do

I have a [To Do list](TODO.md) that contains a lists of actions I need to complete. This list is aimed at keeping this learning diary up to date.
