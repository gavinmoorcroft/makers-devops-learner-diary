# My DevOps Apprenticeship Learner Diary

This is intended to be my Learning Diary as I move through the Makers DevOPs Apprenticeship. 

This will be the place where I keep notes and code snippets that I find useful, as well as a place for me to track my module work. But more importantly, I will use this space to track my progress through evaluations, not just into my learning rate but also my emotional state, achievements, 

## To Do

I have a [To Do list](TODO.md) that contains a lists of actions I need to complete. This list is aimed at keeping this learning diary up to date.

## Modules

There is a number of folders in the [modules folder](modules/README.md). Each of these folders will align with a single module and contain any evidence required to show I have completed that module. They will also a retrospectic each for my progress through that module.
