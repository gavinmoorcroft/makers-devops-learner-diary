# My DevOps Apprenticeship Learner Diary

This is intended to be my Learning Diary as I move through the Makers DevOPs Apprenticeship. 

This will be the place where I keep notes and code snippets that I find useful, as well as a place for me to track my module work. But more importantly, I will use this space to track my progress through evaluations, not just into my learning rate but also my emotional state, achievements and lows as I progress.

## Diary

There is a number of folders in the [Diary folder](Diary/README.md). Each of these folders will align with a single module and contain a diary of that module contianing a retrospectic on how I feel I dealt with that module, any evidence that I feel I should keep for it and anything else I feel is of use.
