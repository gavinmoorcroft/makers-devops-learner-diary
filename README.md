# My DevOps Apprenticeship Learner Diary

This is intended to be my Learning Diary as I move through the Makers DevOPs Apprenticeship. 

This will be the place where I keep notes, code snippets that I find useful and module work. But more importantly, I will use this space to track my progress through evaluations, not just into my learning rate but also my emotional state, achievements, 

## To Do

I have a TODO.md that contains a lists actions I need to do. This list is aimed at keeping this learning diary up to date. By the end of the week the to do list shoudl all be checked off.

## Modules

There is a number of folders in the [modules folder](modules/README.md). Each of these folders will align with a single module and contain any evidence required to show I have completed that module. They will also a retrospectic each for my progress through that module.
